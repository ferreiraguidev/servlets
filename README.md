## Understanding what's behind the scenes. Servlets

Understanding what's behind the scenes it's actually a course called Java Servlet: Fundamentos da programação web Java, where we can learn how to simulate Database and create a simple CRUD. 

The main objective of this course, i believe so, is to teach the students what is behind the scenes in our current scenario by making you understand how Servlets work, what are they and what can they do. (Some ancient practices are also shown in this course, as using xml files and deploying the application through .zip). That's why i picked up the name Behind the Scenes. :scroll:
